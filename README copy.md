# Admin Dashboard
This is the final project for the Odin Project's Intermediate HTML & CSS course.

It is not meant to be fully responsive, but rather a good starting point to flex (pun-intended) the skills I learned using flexbox and grid.

## Future enhancements

It is my intention to re-visit this project in the future and use it as a starting point for a future project. However, there are a few updates that I would like to make:

1. Update hardcoded values to em/rem values where possible
2. Add button interactivity and functionality
3. Update color palette
